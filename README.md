# CAPSTONE-Customer-Subscription-Project
This is where i documented my second main LITA PROJECT on Customer Segmentation for a Subscription service.
---

## Project Title: Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service.

### Project Overview: This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify 
segments,trends and to understand customer behavior, track subscription types,and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals, for interactive Power BI dashboard visualization.
The dataset consists of information such as customer demographics, subscription history, usage patterns, and transaction records. This project highlights my analytical skills in data processing, clustering techniques, and visualization, providing a comprehensive look at how data-driven segmentation can drive business decisions.


### Project Objectives: The primary objective of this project is to segment customers of a subscription service into distinct groups based on shared characteristics and behaviors. By leveraging these insights, the business can better understand customer needs, personalize marketing strategies, and improve customer satisfaction and retention. This segmentation will enable the company to optimize its offerings, increase engagement, and reduce churn, thereby driving long-term growth.









Key Techniques and Tools:

Data Cleaning and Processing: Handling missing values, standardizing data, and preparing features for clustering.

Clustering Algorithms: Using methods such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN to perform segmentation.

Visualization Tools: Using Power BI, Tableau, or Python (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create intuitive visuals that explain segmentation insights.

Interpretation and Reporting: Creating a detailed report or presentation to demonstrate findings, using data storytelling techniques to make insights actionable.
