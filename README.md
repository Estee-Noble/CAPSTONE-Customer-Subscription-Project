# CAPSTONE-Customer-Subscription-Project
This is where i documented my second main LITA PROJECT on Customer Segmentation for a Subscription service.

## Project Title: Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service.

### Project Overview: This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify 
segments,trends and to understand customer behavior, track subscription types,and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals, for interactive Power BI dashboard visualization.
The dataset consists of information such as customer demographics, subscription history, usage patterns, and transaction records. This project highlights my analytical skills in data processing, clustering techniques, and visualization, providing a comprehensive look at how data-driven segmentation can drive business decisions.


### Project Objectives: The primary objective of this project is to segment customers of a subscription service into distinct groups based on shared characteristics and behaviors. By leveraging these insights, the business can better understand customer needs, personalize marketing strategies, and improve customer satisfaction and retention. This segmentation will enable the company to optimize its offerings, increase engagement, and reduce churn, thereby driving long-term growth.


### Scope of Analysis

#### 1. Customer Segmentation:

Group customers based on features like region, subscription type, revenue generated, and whether they canceled.
Identify distinct customer profiles to reveal patterns in subscription preferences, regional engagement differences, and revenue potential by segment.

#### 2. Subscription Lifecycle and Duration Analysis:

Calculate each customerâ€™s subscription duration and examine trends in start and end dates.
Understand how long different customer segments remain active and identify common points in the subscription lifecycle where cancellations occur.

#### 3. Churn and Retention Analysis:

Analyze cancellation patterns to understand the characteristics of customers likely to churn.
Identify potential reasons for cancellations and determine which segments have higher or lower churn rates.

#### 4. Revenue Analysis:

Assess revenue per customer by segment and subscription type to understand the financial contribution of each group.
Identify high-value customers or segments to prioritize for retention and upsell efforts.


### Data Collection Approach

1. Data Cleaning:

Handle any missing values, correct inconsistencies, and standardize formats (e.g., dates and categorical variables).

Ensure that fields like Subscription Start Date and Subscription End Date are in a consistent date format.



2. Data Processing:

Derive additional features such as Subscription Duration (difference between Subscription Start Date and Subscription End Date).

Flag cancellations and compute Revenue over time for each customer segment.



3. Data Aggregation:

Group data by different categories, such as Region and Subscription Type, to support segmentation and revenue analysis.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):

Average revenue generated by a customer over the duration of their subscription. This is key for understanding segment profitability.



2. Average Subscription Duration:

Calculate the average time customers stay subscribed before cancellation. This metric helps in identifying segments with higher or lower retention.



3. Churn Rate:

Percentage of customers who cancel their subscription within a specific time period. Useful to assess retention strategies for each segment.



4. Revenue per Segment:

Total revenue generated by each segment (e.g., by region or subscription type). Helps in determining the financial impact of each segment.



5. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):

A measure of the predictable revenue generated by active subscriptions each month. Can be used to assess the stability of revenue over time.



6. Conversion Rate by Subscription Type:

Percentage of customers choosing each subscription type. This will help in understanding the popularity of each plan and identifying upsell opportunities.

Tools for Analysis

1. Data Cleaning and Processing:

Excel: For basic data cleaning, filtering, and feature engineering.

Python or R: For more advanced data manipulation (using libraries like Pandas in Python).



2. Data Analysis and Visualization:

Power BI or Tableau: For creating dashboards to visualize customer segments, revenue trends, and churn analysis.

Python: For exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations (using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn).



3. Clustering and Segmentation:

Python (Scikit-Learn): For clustering algorithms like K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering to perform segmentation.

SQL: To aggregate data and create views for different customer segments based on certain criteria.



4. Reporting:

Power BI or Tableau: To create interactive reports that display KPIs, segment profiles, and insights.

Excel or Google Sheets: For final summaries, tables, and static reporting if necessary.
